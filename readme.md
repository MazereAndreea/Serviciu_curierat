# Project developed within the course Program Systems Engineering. 
### Description of project: <br> 
This project is a simple simulation of a *delivery system* with 
classes representing various components involved in the process: Client, Curier, Comanda , Manager, and SistemPlata. 
The project models the interactions between these entities, simulating the process of creating orders, assigning couriers, 
tracking order statuses, and handling payments and complaints.

### What did I use and learn?
- OOP principles such as inheritance, association and abstraction
- C++ for creating classes and instances
- Visual Studio as IDE 
- UML diagrams to emphasize system's architecture
- From this course I learned the importance of requirements for a product and regular testing to ensure proper development.
